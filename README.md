# Elm Web Development
This is the code repository for [Elm Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/elm-web-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788299053), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Elm is easy to get started with. The learning curve is not too steep. Elm does not introduce
an overwhelming amount of new concepts to understand and learn; actually, it is quite the
opposite. Once you learn the Elm way of doing things, with the focus on some key concepts
of functional programming, there is not a huge number of new topics to understand.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
main : HTML Never
main =
 view
```

To get the most out of this book, you should be familiar with HTML, CSS, the
way the web works, Bootstrap 4, and MDL.
Elm installation and setup are covered in Chapter 1, Why is This a Great Time to
Learn Elm?, and will be updated in the code that comes with the book in the case
of any changes, updates, or errata.
